## Description
This was a project that introduced the concept of modularization and test driven development. So the main things I learned in this is separating javascript classes into different javascript files and then using the inheritance system to make certain classes children of others. By running node index.js in the terminal the user is prompted for information and then that information is used to output an SVG string that is displayed on a basic HTML page.
